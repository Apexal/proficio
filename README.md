# Proficio
>To prepare me for what is to come.

Proficio will be a way to manage as many aspects of my life as it possibly can and provide a means of organizing, categorizing, recording, and improving daily life. It will also provide opportunities for self-reflection and improvement.

But that's all pretty abstract stuff. What it really will be is a single page web app using VueJS and NodeJS in the backend along with MongoDB (NOT SURE YET)

Different components of the website should all be generally separated by purpose, i.e. school is separate from social life which is separate from self-reflection.

# Current Components
- Nothing...

# Planned Components

## School
**Daily School Life** - Provide a centralized place for all school management without replacing any of the functions of the already overly fragmented school technical system. Link your courses, clubs, teachers, and realtime class schedule to the system to get an realtime overview of school life. This includes an actually useful realtime class schedule, quick links to all important school sites or course pages, etc.

**Work Management** - Record your daily assignments so that homework can be divided and conquered. Linked to your class schedule, this will provide the ideal homework strategy including best order of assignments to complete, when to complete them, and which could be left till later. 

**Academic Goals** - Record concrete academic goals and milestones you want to reach

## Personal Development
**Strengths/Weaknesses** - Focus on self-improvement by identifying aspects of your character which need improvement or you are unhappy with. Each day a random weakness and/or strength is picked to be the central focus of the day to keep it in mind. Items can be weighted such that more emphasis is put on them. Optional daily email will remind you of what the day's choices are.

**Daily Reflections** - Write down your thoughts and feelings about the day, along with records of what happened, to organize your thoughts and eventually see patterns in thinking. Also useful to save those memories you want to keep. Also rate each day on a scale from 1 to 5 (**TODO:** confirm) in general to be able to easily visualize trends after a period of time.

## Social Life
**People Directory** - Organize your thoughts and feelings about the people you know by having a page for each of them. Write down notes for reminders, and record memories or stories you don't want to forget. Identify what you like and dislike about each person and categorize certain characteristics on scales. 

## Time Management
**Google Calendar** - *[NOT SURE IF POSSIBLE]* Connect to your Google calendar and edit it to set aside time for everything.

In the end, with all of the above data stored, the web app should be able to get a good idea of you (me). Not sure what you should be doing at any moment? This web app will tell you what you could be doing, and for how long. I don't really know how feasible this is... and would something like that count as some sort of primitive AI? In theory it will take in all the data you've saved, and data about the current time, process it, and tell you what would most benefit you from doing at the current time, whether its a certain homework item, or working on a far away paper, or reaching out to a friend, or just meditating for 20 minutes. 

# Contributing
If I know you, e.g. a fellow schoolmate, and you want to learn how to code or already know some and want to get some experience, just ask me and I'll be happy to share this project with you and help you learn how to contribute to it, or fork it and make it your own.

Just note that if you want to contribute to this main project, I have total control over what goes here and intend to have this application be specifically tailored to myself.
